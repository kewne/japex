# Japex

Japex is a Haskell application for doing japanese vocabulary exercises.

It uses a plain-text database with japanese-english expression pairs 
and supports categories for more focused workouts.

AFAIK it's completely broken on Windows because of a lack of monospace
        fonts with japanese characters for the command line (please shoot me an email if this is wrong/fixable somehow).
